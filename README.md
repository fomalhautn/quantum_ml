# quantum_ml
This lab puts into practice the machine learning (ML) techniques. Classical ML models such as K Nearest and Linear Regression will be coded up to train the MNIST and Diabetes datasets. Then quantum ML models will be coded such as the Quantum Support Vector Machine and Quantum Variational Classifier to train the Iris and Wine datasets.
